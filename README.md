Key Features:

Dynamic Time Display: The application dynamically displays the current time, including the day and date.

Alarm Setting: Users can set alarms by specifying the hour, minute, second, and AM/PM.

Active Alarms Display: Active alarms are shown in a separate section with checkboxes for activation and delete buttons.

Audio Notification: When an alarm time matches the current time, an audio notification ("Oppo - Nostalgic.mp3") plays continuously until the user deactivates the alarm.

Functionality:
The project uses JavaScript to handle alarm creation, activation, deactivation, and deletion.

Alarms are stored in an array (alarmsArray) with properties such as ID, hour, minute, second, and activation status.

The application converts and displays time in a 12-hour format, with AM/PM indication.

Users can interact with the interface to set, activate, and delete alarms.

Set Alarm: Enter the desired time and click the "Add Alarm" button.

Activate/Deactivate Alarm: Check or uncheck the checkbox next to each alarm.

Delete Alarm: Click the trash icon to remove an alarm.
